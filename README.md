# SQL-Case-Studies
A collection of 8 SQL case studies where I analyze datasets, answer key business questions, and solve complex business problems. Each case study is designed to demonstrate practical SQL skills, including data extraction, manipulation, and in-depth analysis, with a focus on deriving actionable insights to inform business decisions.
